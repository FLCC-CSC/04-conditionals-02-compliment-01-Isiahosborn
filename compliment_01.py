'''

1. On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is the hardest), how would you rate this lab?
2/10

2. What was the hardest part of this lab?
Making sure the behavior matched the sample output exactlyâ€”only printing the compliment when the input is exactly "yes" (lowercase), and always printing "Thank you for playing." regardless of the answer. Also paying attention to the prompt text and spacing so the outputs line up.
